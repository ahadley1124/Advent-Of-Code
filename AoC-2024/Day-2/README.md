# Day 0 Template

This is a template day that will be used to copy the structure for the other days. It will contain the README.md file and the folders for the Rust and V code. The README.md file will contain the instructions for the day and links to the input and output files.

## Instructions

The instructions for the day will go here.

## Input

The input for the day can be found [here](input.txt).

## Output

The output for the day can be found [here](output.txt).

## How to run the code

### Rust

To run the Rust code, you will need to have Rust installed on your machine. You can install Rust by following the instructions on the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once you have Rust installed, you can run the code by navigating to the day you want to run and running the following command:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

### V

To run the V code, you will need to have V installed on your machine. You can install V by following the instructions on the [V website](https://vlang.io/).
It is recommended to install V from the source and not the pre-built binaries as the pre-built binaries are not always up to date.

Once you have V installed, you can run the code by navigating to the day you want to run, enter the V directory and run the following command:

```bash
v run .
```

# Advent of Code 2024

## Solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 puzzles.

This repository contains my code and ways to get to the solution for the puzzles of the Advent of Code 2024.
The code is written in Rust and I will try and translate it to V, a language I am currently learning.
Each Day will be in it's own folder and Rust and V code will be in separate folders within the days.

## Day 0

Day 0 is a template day that will be used to copy the structure for the other days. It will contain the README.md file and the folders for the Rust and V code. The README.md file will contain the instructions for the day and links to the input and output files.

## How to run the code

### Rust

To run the Rust code, you will need to have Rust installed on your machine. You can install Rust by following the instructions on the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once you have Rust installed, you can run the code by navigating to the day you want to run and running the following command:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

### V

To run the V code, you will need to have V installed on your machine. You can install V by following the instructions on the [V website](https://vlang.io/).
It is recommended to install V from the source and not the pre-built binaries as the pre-built binaries are not always up to date.

Once you have V installed, you can run the code by navigating to the day you want to run, enter the V directory and run the following command:

```bash
v run .
```
